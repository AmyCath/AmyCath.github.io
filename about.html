  <p id= "introText">I'm Amy, a second year undergraduate studying Computer Science at Newcastle University. During my third year and my integrated masters I will be specialising in Security and Resilience. From July 2021-August 2022 I'll be undertaking a placement at Matillion as a Security Engineer as part of my degree programme. However, I haven't always been on a STEM path. Here's a bit about my journey.</p>
  
  <h2>Secondary School</h2> 
  <p>While at secondary I found myself drawn to subjects like Engineering and IT, but I also love more creative and humanity based subjects. It was tough to decide on my options, but I ended up taking History, Drama and Computing as my chosen electives. I loved Drama and History, but while I liked the content of the Computing course, the atmosphere of the lessons put me off. I was one of four girls in the class, most of the lads joked around every lesson, taking it as an easy subject because they liked computers and half of the class ended up failing (luckily this didn't include me!). The whole thing massively turned me away from Computer Science, despite me doing an EPQ in Year 11 in which I researched the impact of mobile apps and video games on people's mental and physical health. </p>
  <h2>Sixth Form</h2>
  <p>When it came time to choose my A levels, although I still felt some interest in Computing, after GCSEs I didn't think it was the path for me. Instead I turned to thinking about doing Law at university (spoiler alert: I soon found out that Law? Much much worse than GCSE Computing). After deciding this I chose to do Law, History and Politics at A level with an AS in Maths. Unfortunately I soon realised Law was not the fit for me either. This left me at a crossroads not fully sure what I was going to do and by this point UCAS applications were a heavy point of topic. Then, after some sponsored ads and a bit of googling, I found myself applying to a Cyber Security summer school between my two years of college. It was only a short time period and was free, so I thought why not. Little did I know it would end up setting me on the path I'm still venturing down today. On our last day there we did a big Capture The Flag tournament in our teams and the energy in the room, people running around desks and talking fast, whizzing through files and possible decoding techniques - it was something that I wanted to keep experiencing for the rest of my life. When it came time to apply for universities, I chose only courses that allowed for a specialism in Security.</p>
  <h2>University</h2>
  <p>I was lucky enough to receive offers from all the universities I'd applied to, which I found bizarre since my grades were all from very different subjects to Computing and my application spoke about my time on debate club rather than coding club. However, after an open day I knew Newcastle was the place for me. Adjusting to university is never plain sailing but especially not when you don't have the experience with the subject like most others do. My first year was filled with impostor syndrome and trying to wrap my head around Java. Then in March we were all sent home at the start of the first lockdown and I haven't been back to my university building since. In spite of this, my time working from home has been filled with achievements that keep pushing me through each moment of doubt. From my first year grade of 83% to taking a leadership position in our rather big Software Engineering Team Project module, each of these small victories have kept me going through times of poor mental wellbeing and seeing the around 70/30 split of males to females on my course. Over my time here I've come to learn that anyone from any background can succeed in STEM if they put in hard work and stop doubting their abilities. I think it's a more common trait in females to second guess themselves and their skills, especially in a male dominant environment, but the moment things start to get easier for yourself is when you realise that everyone in the roomis just as confused as you are.</p>
