<p>The STS programme has been extremely beneficial these past few months being on it. Even right at the beginning in the match-up session it was so liberating to meet so many amazing women who were working in STEM, being able to see successful people like me in the field I wanted to go into. I remember feeling  sort of high after the session, not much caring who specifically I got as a mentor because they were all so amazing.</p>
  <p>Now, though, I'm so glad to have been through this journey with Sotira. Every meeting has felt easygoing and I've come out of every single one with more insight than before I saw her. I was worried being in lockdown may detract from it all, but the programme helped serve as a great distraction at times from being stuck inside with little communication to the outside world. Throughout it all, I've built my confidence, my communication skills, my leadership skills and I've learned that all of my worries? So many other people get them too. The experience has been fantastic and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in STEM because you will learn so much, make so many connections and get to know a fantastic mentor, whoever yours may be.</p>
