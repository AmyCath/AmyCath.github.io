   <div class="2"> <h4>Goal:</h4> <p>Ask lecturers five questions in my first semester at university. </p><h4>Outcome:</h4> <p>Throughout my first semester I sent various lecturers from my modules emails with questions I had about coursework and material and it helped me overcome my anxieties surrounding asking for help at university. </p>

      <h4>Goal:</h4> <p>Serve as team leader in my Software Engineering module. </p><h4>Outcome:</h4> <p>For the 8 weeks the module ran I served as team leader, heading meetings, keeping track of progress and liasing with members. I also had to deal with a participation issue with one of the members, communicating with module leaders to update them on the situation. As we begin to receive marks back, we've received above 73% in every task so far. Furthermore, my team were happy with how I led them and had great things to say. After this I'm hoping to develop this skill even further. </p>

      <h4>Goal:</h4> <p>Practice interview questions and prep before undertaking a mock interview. </p><h4>Outcome:</h4> <p>I practiced interview questions with Sotira before having a mock interview with AO early December, quickly followed by a real interview with Matillion for an industrial placement. I received good feedback from my mock interview and received and accepted a job offer from Matillion. I'm looking forward to starting my placement as a Security Engineer in early July. </p>
