    <div class="item2"> <p> In August I was told who my Sherpa would be and we set up our first meeting. I was really worried before our first meeting because I thought I may not click properly as I'd only met Sotira for a few minutes during the matching event. When we did meet, I found out I had nothing to worry about. We worked through the introduction sheet provided by Stemettes, doing things like two truths and a lie and personality quizzes to learn more about one another. This first meeting really helped put me at ease and by the time the hour was over, I couldn't wait for our next one.

      <p>During the month of September Sotira and I had our second meeting in which we turned to setting goals. After discussing SMART goals and how to set them, I started to think about what I wanted to improve. Coming into the program I knew I wanted to try and build on my confidence. Consequently, one of the first goals I set was about trying to gain confidence within university. I struggled to ask questions in my first year as I was anxious about looking like I didn't belong there. From this we set the goal that I would ask five questions to lecturers before the end of Semester One which would finish in December. Next I set a careers goal as my next degree year would be work placement. This goal was to practice interview style questions with Sotira and attend a mock interview in two months time. Finally, I set a leadership goal. We left the specifics of this until the next meeting as I was still looking for an opportunity to lead.

      <p>In October we worked a bit on my careers goal, looking at interview questions and the formats in which you can resoond to them. I had been researching STAR answers and been practicing some answers using it so we were able to discuss these. Sotira had some great insights into how interviews were structured and I was able to gain some useful information. I went away with some websites to look at and even more questions to try my hand at. I also sent my mentor my CV this month to gain useful feedback. Using this I was able to better my CV and learn more about what's expected from one in the STEM industry.</p>
