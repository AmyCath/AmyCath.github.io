     <p>I started the Student to Stemette Programme back in August 2020. I was just about to start my second year of university and thought it would be the perfect 
    opportunity to build my confidence and networking skills and connect with a real industry professional. Over the months I was able to
    set and work toward foals, discuss my CV and practice my interview skills with my mentor Sotira. The impact this programme has had 
    for me has been tremendous; it's been everything I was hoping for and more. To go into more detail, I'm going to go over 
       what happened each month.</p>
