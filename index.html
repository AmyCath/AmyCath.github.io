     <p id="introText">I started the Student to Stemette Programme back in August 2020. I was just about to start my second year of university and thought it would be the perfect opportunity to build my confidence and networking skills and connect with a real industry professional. Over the months I was able to
    set and work toward goals, discuss my CV and practice my interview skills with my mentor Sotira. The impact this programme has had 
    for me has been tremendous; it's been everything I was hoping for and more. To go into more detail, I'm going to go over 
       what happened each month.</p>

    <div class="item2"> <p> In August I was told who my Sherpa would be and we set up our first meeting. I was really worried before our first meeting because I thought I may not click properly as I'd only met Sotira for a few minutes during the matching event. When we did meet, I found out I had nothing to worry about. We worked through the introduction sheet provided by Stemettes, doing things like two truths and a lie and personality quizzes to learn more about one another. This first meeting really helped put me at ease and by the time the hour was over, I couldn't wait for our next one.

      <p>During the month of September Sotira and I had our second meeting in which we turned to setting goals. After discussing SMART goals and how to set them, I started to think about what I wanted to improve. Coming into the program I knew I wanted to try and build on my confidence. Consequently, one of the first goals I set was about trying to gain confidence within university. I struggled to ask questions in my first year as I was anxious about looking like I didn't belong there. From this we set the goal that I would ask five questions to lecturers before the end of Semester One which would finish in December. Next I set a careers goal as my next degree year would be work placement. This goal was to practice interview style questions with Sotira and attend a mock interview in two months time. Finally, I set a leadership goal. We left the specifics of this until the next meeting as I was still looking for an opportunity to lead.

      <p>In October we worked a bit on my careers goal, looking at interview questions and the formats in which you can resoond to them. I had been researching STAR answers and been practicing some answers using it so we were able to discuss these. Sotira had some great insights into how interviews were structured and I was able to gain some useful information. I went away with some websites to look at and even more questions to try my hand at. I also sent my mentor my CV this month to gain useful feedback. Using this I was able to better my CV and learn more about what's expected from one in the STEM industry.</p>

    <div class="item7">
      <p>During November we had two separate meetings. In the first we talked about networking and LinkedIn and I gained some useful insights into how to talk to people both on there and at in-person networking events. It was really useful to talk about this as I hadn't networked much before and was worried about how you would strike up conversation with someone. At our second meeting we discussed interviews even more as I had secured one with an industrial placement opportunity that I was looking to gain. Sotira was so helpful during this time and it was great to have someone currently in the workplace to help me look over the job advert and pick out key bits they may ask about and just to have someone I can ask questions while I prepared. By the end of November I felt far more prepared than I would have without these meetings. Furthermore, my leadership goal was specified as I volunteered to be team leader for our big software engineering team project module at university.</p>

    <div class="item10">In December we didn't have an official meeting as we'd had two in November and since we usually have them late in the month, holidays got in the way a bit. However, we kept in contact using Twitter. At the start of the month I'd had a mock interview with AO thanks to the FastFutures program I was completing at the time. I talked to Sotira about how this went in preparation for my real interview with the placement company Matillion. Following this interview I was able to talk it through with Sotira and say how I think it went. Luckily, a few weeks after I was able to also share the news with her that I was offered the placement position as Security Engineer. It felt incredible to be able to see the result of the efforts put in and share the celebration with my mentor that helped me get there.</div>
    <div class="item11">Throughout January I spent a lot of time on university work due to deadlines, but was able to meet with Sotira to discuss my progress with my goals. By this point I had managed to achieve all three of my goals. I had successfully sat through a mock interview and a real interview, managing to secure a placement. Furthermore, I found a role of leadership in one of my modules and completed that module during January with good feedback from my team members. Finally, I was able to email various lecturers throughout the past months with questions I had about coursework or material. We discussed future goals and I decided leadership is something I'd like to keep working on, perhaps through an online course and keeping my eye open for opportunities ot put myself forward for a leader position again. </div>

    <div class="item14">In February we were able to discuss my final project - this website. I had experimented with HTML and CSS a little in GCSE Computer Science then a little bit in one of my modules, but had never fully created a website like his before. After attending the event held to help give us an indication into what to include and how to go about it I was able to create a mockup design of what I wanted the website to look like on paper and discuss it with those at my table. Making that plan a reality was difficult with the little experience I had and took a lot of googling and W3Schools, but I'm really pleased with it. I had Sotira look over it to get feedback on what I was missing or any suggestions for improvement. I was then able to use this to make changes to the site. Overall, I'm glad I chose the website option for documenting my journey as it's really pushed my skills.</div>
    <div class="item15">Looking forward to March, Sotira and I will be having our last meeting and it will be graduation time. This program was been helpful in so many ways, helping me with impostor syndrome, with confidence and leadership and with connecting me to a female professional that I can look up to through it all. I can't believe how fast time has flown that we're nearly at the end but I couldn't be more grateful for the opportunity I was given to participate in STS.</div>
