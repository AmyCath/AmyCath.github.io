     <p id="introText">I started the Student to Stemette Programme back in August 2020. I was just about to start my second year of university and thought it would be the perfect 
    opportunity to build my confidence and networking skills and connect with a real industry professional. Over the months I was able to
    set and work toward foals, discuss my CV and practice my interview skills with my mentor Sotira. The impact this programme has had 
    for me has been tremendous; it's been everything I was hoping for and more. To go into more detail, I'm going to go over 
       what happened each month.</p>

    <div class="item2"> <p> In August I was told who my Sherpa would be and we set up our first meeting. I was really worried before our
                      first meeting because I thought I may not click properly as I'd only met Sotira for a few minutes during the matching event. When 
                      we did meet, I found out I had nothing to worry about. We worked through the introduction sheet provided by Stemettes,
                      doing things like two truths and a lie and personality quizzes to learn more about one another. This first meeting really
                      helped put me at ease and by the time the hour was over, I couldn't wait for our next one.
